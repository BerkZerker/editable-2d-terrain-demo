# Chunk.tscn Documentation

This scene (`Chunk.tscn`) defines a single chunk of destructible terrain. It's a reusable scene that is instantiated multiple times by the `World.gd` script to form the complete game world.

## Scene Structure

*   **Chunk (Node2D)**
    *   This is the root node of the chunk scene.
    *   It has the `Chunk.gd` script attached to it, which handles the generation of the visual mesh and collision shapes for this specific chunk.
    *   **Script:** `res://scripts/Chunk.gd`

*   **MeshInstance2D (MeshInstance2D)**
    *   This is a child node of `Chunk`.
    *   It is responsible for rendering the visual mesh of the terrain within this chunk.
    *   The `Chunk.gd` script dynamically generates and assigns an `ArrayMesh` to this node's `mesh` property.

*   **StaticBody2D (StaticBody2D)**
    *   This is a child node of `Chunk`.
    *   It acts as a container for the collision shapes of the terrain within this chunk.
    *   `StaticBody2D` is a physics body that does not move and is unaffected by gravity or other forces. It's ideal for static level geometry like terrain.
    *   The `Chunk.gd` script dynamically creates and adds `CollisionPolygon2D` nodes as children to this `StaticBody2D` to define the terrain's collision boundaries.

## Extending and Maintaining

*   **Visual Appearance:** To change how the terrain looks, you would primarily modify the `Chunk.gd` script, specifically the `initalize_mesh()` function, to alter how the `ArrayMesh` is generated (e.g., using different colors, textures, or shaders).
*   **Collision Behavior:** The collision shapes are also generated by `Chunk.gd`. If you need to adjust how collisions work (e.g., different friction, bounce), you would modify the properties of the `StaticBody2D` or the `CollisionPolygon2D` nodes created by the script.
*   **Adding Effects:** You could add child nodes to the `Chunk` (e.g., `CPUParticles2D` for dust effects when terrain is destroyed) and control them from the `Chunk.gd` script.
*   **Do Not Manually Add Collision Shapes:** The `Chunk.gd` script is designed to dynamically generate collision shapes. You should not manually add `CollisionShape2D` or `CollisionPolygon2D` nodes directly as children of `StaticBody2D` in this scene, as they will likely be overwritten or conflict with the script's generated shapes.
